### Features
- Encrypt plaintext into ciphertext using a symmetric key.
- Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext using the same key.
- Generate a secure key for encryption and decryption.

### Installation
You have to  install cryptography module of python using pip:

```
pip install cryptography
```

###Usage


Encrypting Text
To encrypt text, use the following command:

This will prompt you to enter a key for encryption. Once the encryption is complete, it will display the ciphertext.

Decrypting Text
To decrypt ciphertext, use the following command:

This will prompt you to enter the key used for encryption. Once the decryption is complete, it will display the original plaintext.
